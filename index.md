## Welcome to Steve's Github Page
<p>
<br />It's Early June 2020.  We're in the middle of 'another' world meltdown so I decided this would be the ideal time to learn to code ðŸ˜Š<brv><br>

<br>I was lucky enough to get on Stanford's ['Code In Place 2020'](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/05/07/students-instructors-share-thoughts-on-free-course-code-in-place/) project, which was a blast.  

Now I've ended up down the rabbit hole and using Github and making webpages...and really enjoying the challenge<br>

I'm leaving these pages here so that I might actually read them at somre point.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chmod730/chmod730.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chmod730/chmod730.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
